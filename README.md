The live stream is used to present the meetup to those individuals who cannot attend the meetup event in person. It also allows the meetup event to be accessed by a remote live captioner.

## Create the YouTube Live Stream instance
1. Log into the A11YChi YouTube account.
2. Navigate to the Creator Studio.
3. Select **Live Streaming**, then **Events**.
4. Select **New Live Event**
5. Add the title of the meetup, select the events start and end date and time, add the meetup event's description and some tags (ex. accessibility, a11y, meetup).
6. Select **Create Event**.
