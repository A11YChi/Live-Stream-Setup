# Live Stream Setup
Instructions on how to set up the live stream for meetup events

The live stream is used to present the meetup to those individuals who cannot attend the meetup event in person. It also allows the meetup event to be accessed by a remote live captioner.

## Create the YouTube Live Stream instance
1. Log into the A11YChi YouTube account.
2. Navigate to the Creator Studio.
3. Select **Live Streaming**, then **Events**.
4. Select **New Live Event**
5. Add the title of the meetup, select the events start and end date and time, add the meetup event's description and some tags (ex. accessibility, a11y, meetup).
6. Ensure the Live event is "Public," and the type "Quick - using Google Hangout" is selected.  
7. Select **Create Event**.

## Accessing the Live Stream Event (At the Event)
On the day of the event, 
1. Log into YouTube and navigate to Live Stream Events. 
2. Close to the start of the event, select the "Start Hangout on Air" button.
3. Ensure the position of the laptop camera is appropriate.
4. Minutes before the start of the live stream event (ex. just after housekeeping announcements), select the "Start Broadcast" button to begin the stream.

Once the presentation is over, select the "Stop Broadcast" button. Make sure to end the stream by then hanging up on the "call."

## Setting Up the Live Stream Camera (At the Event)
Typically, a laptop cam is used to stream the event. The laptop must be connected to a strong, dependable wi-fi network to stream a quality event. The laptop should be positioned so that the speaker and screen are included. Make sure to consider that there are barrier-free sightlines (i.e. no one sitting in front of the laptop).

## Setting Up the Microphone for the Live Stream
A lapel microphone is used to mic the speaker, having their voice come across the live stream clearly, ensuring the remote live captioner can hear the spoken word properly. The lapel microphone typically has an extension cable to ensure lenth and reach to the speaker.

Connect the microphone to the laptop and extend the lapel microphone out to ensure there's enough reach. YOu may want to ensure the cable is not tripped on my attendees, by taping it down in trafficked areas. YOu will want to do a sound check to ensure there are proper sound levels.

**Note:** you should monitor the live stream, noting the quality of sound, to ensure there are no issues.
