# Live Stream Setup
Instructions on how to set up the live stream for meetup events

The live stream is used to present the meetup to those individuals who cannot attend the meetup event in person. It also allows the meetup event to be accessed by a remote live captioner.

## Create the YouTube Live Stream instance
1. Log into the A11YChi YouTube account.
2. Navigate to the Creator Studio.
3. Select **Live Streaming**, then **Events**.
4. Select **New Live Event**
5. Add the title of the meetup, select the events start and end date and time, add the meetup event's description and some tags (ex. accessibility, a11y, meetup).
